-- This migration ensures the parse-client-info edge function can work properly
-- No database changes needed as we're using Supabase secrets for API key storage

-- Note: The OPENAI_API_KEY should be added to Supabase Edge Function secrets
-- This is handled through the Supabase dashboard, not through migrations

SELECT 'Migration completed - OPENAI_API_KEY should be configured in Supabase Edge Function secrets' as status;
