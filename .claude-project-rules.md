# 🚫 CLAUDE PROJECT RULES - ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENTS

## **CRITICAL RULE #1: NEVER LOCALHOST**
- ❌ NEVER suggest localhost testing (`npm run dev`, `http://localhost:*`)
- ❌ NEVER mention local development servers
- ❌ NEVER assume local testing workflow
- ✅ ALWAYS use deployed environment only
- ✅ ALWAYS assume production deployment workflow
- ✅ ALWAYS test on live/deployed sites

## **CRITICAL RULE #2: ALWAYS CREATE DEBUG SCREENS**
- ❌ NEVER guess what's wrong
- ❌ NEVER provide theoretical solutions
- ❌ NEVER say "try this" without debug tools
- ✅ ALWAYS create visible debug components
- ✅ ALWAYS add console logging
- ✅ ALWAYS make problems visible in UI
- ✅ ALWAYS create real-time debugging tools

## **DEBUGGING WORKFLOW (MANDATORY)**
1. **Create debug component/screen** - Make problem visible
2. **Add to live codebase** - Deploy debugging tools  
3. **Deploy to see results** - Test on live environment
4. **Fix based on visible data** - Use debug output to solve

## **FORBIDDEN ACTIONS**
- 🚫 localhost suggestions
- 🚫 guessing problems without debug tools
- 🚫 theoretical "this might work" solutions
- 🚫 "try running npm run dev" 
- 🚫 "open http://localhost"

## **REQUIRED ACTIONS**
- ✅ Create debug screens for every problem
- ✅ Add console logging for visibility
- ✅ Make debug tools production-ready
- ✅ Use deployed environment for all testing
- ✅ Show data visually in the UI

## **PROJECT CONTEXT**
This is a production React/TypeScript application that should ONLY be tested on deployed environments. All debugging must work in production. Local development is NOT part of the workflow.

**REMEMBER: DEBUG FIRST, NEVER GUESS, NEVER LOCALHOST**
